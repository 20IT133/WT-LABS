          Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to
          moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment. However, some
          will become seriously ill and require medical attention. HOW IT
          SPREADS The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose
          in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or
          breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to
          smaller aerosols. You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you
          are near someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated
          surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more
          easily indoors and in crowded settings.

          ><b>What To Do Immediately After You Test Positive For COVID-19?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i>After you have taken your COVID-19
          test and the results have come out as positive, there are a number of
          things that need to be done so as to avoid any further complications
          during the recovery process. In saying this, it is important to keep
          in mind that most people that contract the virus face mild symptoms
          and recover relatively easily. The mortality rate of Coronavirus has
          also been more or less the same over the past 6 weeks. Hence, when
          looked at it objectively, a smooth recovery from the virus can be
          achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i
          ><label>Step 1-"Self Isolate":</label>As soon as you have tested
          positive for the Coronavirus, you must self-isolate as soon as
          possible. Make the necessary adjustments and preparations to isolate
          yourself from all the household members for at least 14 days since the
          last possible exposure to the virus. Try to isolate yourself in a well
          ventilated room. Keep the doors closed at all times and wear a triple
          layer mask as much as possible. This mask must be changed every 8
          hours and the used mask must be correctly disposed to avoid
          contamination of the surroundings. A single caretaker should regularly
          check up on you provided that they are wearing the appropriate PPE
          (Personal Protective Equipment) and an N 95 mask. During the period of
          self isolation, it can become taxing to be devoid on any physical
          interactions. Make sure to keep in touch with loved ones through
          social media. It is also recommended to utilise this time to take up
          some hobbies and activities like painting, singing, writing and so on
          to avoid boredom as much as possible. Try to maintain a positive
          environment to avoid your mental health from taking a toll.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i
          ><label>Step 2-"Regular monitoring":</label>It is absolutely crucial
          to monitor yourself and check on your recovery progress and statistics
          throughout the isolation period. Use an oximeter to frequently check
          your oxygen levels as well as a thermometer to check your temperature.
          It is good to maintain a record of all your results and any
          irregularities can help identify as to whether further assistance is
          required. Eat nutritious meals and stay hydrated. This aids in keeping
          your immune system as stable as possible and promotes a smoother
          recovery.

        <p>
          <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i
          ><label>Step 3-"Medications": </label>It is advised to resort to
          supportive medicines such as cough syrups and paracetamol to help any
          mild symptoms of the virus. However, you must never listen to anyone
          besides a professional and take any other medications or antibiotics
          unless specifically prescribed by your doctor as this could aggravate
          the infection or cause unnecessary side effects which would retard the
          recovery process. Always consult a doctor or an expert before
          implementing any drastic medical changes to your recovery and self
          isolation routine.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i
          ><label>Step 4-"Seek medical attention":</label>Medical attention is
          necessary regardless of the severity of the infection. In general
          infection scenarios, the right self isolation procedure and care is
          satisfactory for a seamless recovery without the need for
          hospitalisation. Stay in touch with a doctor through phone or video
          calls to help check for diagnosis and recovery progress reports.
          However, in the case where the infection is between moderate to
          severe, contact a doctor immediately. If you are having difficulty in
          breathing, persistent pain, a fever of 101 degrees celsius or above or
          are finding it difficult to wake up or stay awake, it is advised that
          you contact a professional caretaker. There are just a few of the
          symptoms caused by the new variant of the coronavirus.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i
          ><label>Step 5-"Stay calm":</label>Stay relaxed and focused as soon as
          you test positive for COVID-19. The saying, “Worrying means you suffer
          twice.” is a very true statement as the problem most likely is not as
          bad as you would think about in your mind. Most of the scenarios and
          possibilities that you would overthink about may not even occur which
          means that you may have spent unnecessary time stressing about
          hypothetical situations which could adversely affect your recovery
          process. Maintaining a stable and calm state of mind is vital during
          the isolation and recovery phase. The entire duration of the infection
          may be as stressful or as stress free as you allow it to be. The true
          key is to stay composed and take the necessary actions as required and
          prescribed by a doctor or a professional. In order to avoid the virus
          winning the battle over your body, you must first conquer it in the
          mind.
